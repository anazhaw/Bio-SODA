This folder contains the benchmark questions in natural language, as well as their corresponding queries in SPARQL, using the joint data from the [Bgee](https://bgee.org/) gene expression database, as well as the [OMA](https://omabrowser.org/oma/home/) orthology database. The names of the folders reflect which SPARQL endpoint should be used in order to obtain up-to-date results for each query, i.e. the [Bgee SPARQL endpoint](https://bgee.org/sparql) or the [OMA SPARQL endpoint](https://sparql.omabrowser.org/sparql). For the federated ones, the queries can be executed in any SPARQL endpoint that supports federation.

These queries have been drafted in collaboration with domain experts and used for evaluating the Bio-SODA question answering system.
