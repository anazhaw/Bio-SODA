NOTE: the original benchmark data, the natural language questions, as well as the golden standard SPARQL queries corresponding to these, are available in the QALD4 challenge [GitHub page](https://github.com/ag-sc/QALD/tree/master/4/data). The questions are copied here only for convenience purposes. We also include notes regarding errors in the questions in the form of comments in the corresponding query file.
